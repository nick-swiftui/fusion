# Fusion

**Fusion** is a collaborative music playback app designed for group listening experiences. Instead of passing one phone around to control the music, Fusion lets one person (the “host”) connect their phone to a speaker, while friends nearby connect to that host’s device via Bluetooth. Anyone connected can see what’s currently playing, add songs to the queue, and control playback in real-time.

# Key Features

**Host-Based Playback**:

A single host device streams music to a speaker.

**Collaborative Queue**:

Connected guests can view the current tracklist, add new songs and rearrange what's up next.

**Real-Time Updates**:

All changes—song additions, skips, play/pause—are instantly visible to everyone connected.

**Simple Bluetooth Setup**:

Guests connect seamlessly to the host over Bluetooth.

**Community-Driven Listening**:

Perfect for parties, road trips, dorm rooms, and any other shared listening environment.
