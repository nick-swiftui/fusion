# Fusion: Music Tool

**Fusion** is a collaborative music playback app designed for group listening experiences. Instead of passing one phone around to control the music, Fusion lets one person (the “host”) connect their phone to a speaker, while friends nearby connect to that host’s device via Bluetooth. Anyone connected can see what’s currently playing, add songs to the queue, and control playback in real-time.

# Key Features

**Host-Based Playback**:

A single host device streams music to a speaker.

**Collaborative Queue**:

Connected guests can view the current tracklist, add new songs and rearrange what's up next.

**Real-Time Updates**:

All changes—song additions, skips, play/pause—are instantly visible to everyone connected.

**Simple Bluetooth Setup**:

Guests connect seamlessly to the host over Bluetooth.

**Community-Driven Listening**:

Perfect for parties, road trips, dorm rooms, and any other shared listening environment.

# How It Works

1. **Host Setup**:
* The host device launches Fusion and enables the 'Scanning' toggle to search for peripherals (guests).

2. **Guest connection**:
* Guests open Fusion on their device.
* They scan the host's QR code to add them as a friend.
* The guest then selects the friend in the fuse view and enables the 'Advertising' toggle.
* The host will be notified of the guest's request to join and they can approve or deny it.

3. **Collaborative Playback**
* Any connected device can play/pause, skip, rewind and queue songs, as well as change the queue order.
